    The <i>Action Code</i> panel is for an optional action-code function. <br/>
    Action-Code is a JavaScript function optionally attached to any rule-tree node, <br/>
    used to modify the native AST of a sub-rule on the fly. <br/>
    A function used as Action-code has the following characteristics:<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>Takes one argument, used as described below.</li>
        <li>Is called twice: first unconditionally before parsing of the <br/>
            associated node begins, and again (only if parsing was successful) <br/>
            after parsing has been completed. The first call receives an argument  <br/>
            of null, while during the second call the argument refers to the <br/>
            AST. </li>
        <li>The AST passed in is a native Java object (e.g. an "Array" will be a <br/>
        Java Object[], not a JavaScript array). The function's code must <br/>
        therefore apply explicit unboxing wherever applicable. </li>
        <li>Must return the modified AST. The returned value becomes part of the <br/>
        larger containing AST (of the associated node's parent node)</li>
    </ul>
    Examples can be seen in the <i>PS2E-ArithExpr-Action</i> sample grammar <br/>
    (click on the nodes with the <i>action</i> attribute)<br/>
