    This panel displays the Abstract Syntax Tree produced by a parser. A well-defined AST structure exists for <br/>
    any rule-tree, defined by applying the following rules recursively to each node in the tree<br/>
    <ul>
        <li>A <i>Sequence</i> yields an "Array" (Object[]) of the sub-rule ASTs. If there is effectively one <br/>
        child node, that node's AST is returned (without the array encapsulation). An effectively empty <br/>
        <i>Sequence</i> produces an empty array</li>
        <li>A <i>Choice</i> yields a 2-element array. The first element is a 0-based index of the matching <br/>
        alternative sub-rule, and the second element is the AST of the matching alternative itself </li>
        <li>A <i>RepSep</i> yields a "List" (java.util.List) with ASTs from applying the first sub-rule. <br/>
        A <i>RepSep</i> with multiplicity * (0 or more) may return an empty List</li>
        <li>A <i>Literal</i> yields a String identical to its pattern, and is shown as such in the AST</li>
        <li>A <i>Regex</i> yields the String matching it's pattern, and is shown as "[" token-name "]"</li>
        <li>A <i>Reference</i> yields the AST of the referred rule, and is shown as "@" rule-name</li>
        <li>A node with an action function yields it's return value, and is shown as "action@" node-name</li>
    </ul>
    The basic structure described above is further modified as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>A multiplicity of * or + yields a "List" with ASTs from applying the basic sub-rule</li>
        <li>A multiplicity of ? yields an "Option" (a 1-element array holding a (possibly null) AST</li>
        <li>A multiplicity of 0 (not) or = (guard) causes the sub-rule to be dropped from the AST <br/>
        These values of multiplicity actually produce <i>syntactic predicates</i></li>
        <li>A <i>drop</i> attribute, obviously, causes the sub-rule to be ignored in the AST</li>
    </ul>
